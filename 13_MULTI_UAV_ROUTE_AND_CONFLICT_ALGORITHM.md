# BlueSky PRO — Zone-Based Multi-UAV Route and 4D Conflict Algorithm

## Purpose

This algorithm defines the planning order for multi-UAV coverage missions. Its primary objective is to prevent trajectory intersections by spatial decomposition before applying temporal or vertical conflict resolution.

## Rules

### 1. Mission / Coverage

The mission defines the coverage geometry, operational boundaries, required resolution/coverage pattern, aircraft fleet and mission constraints.

### 2. Constrained Open Space

Remove all regions that cannot be used for the planned operation. The resulting geometry is the only geometry available to the zone partitioner.

### 3. Zone Partition

Partition the usable geometry into zones/sectors. The preferred result is a **clean zone per UAV**, with boundaries selected so that planned routes do not cross between UAV zones.

The partition should account for:

- aircraft capability;
- payload and coverage requirements;
- operational restrictions;
- launch/recovery geometry;
- required route pattern;
- expected wind/performance;
- workload balance.

### 4. UAV ↔ Zone Assignment

Assign each UAV to one operational zone. Assignment is a planning decision and must be verified against aircraft capability and mission constraints.

### 5. Route-in-Zone

Generate the coverage route entirely within the assigned zone whenever geometrically possible.

The planner must not intentionally create intersecting trajectories and depend on later collision resolution if the same coverage objective can be achieved through zonal decomposition.

### 6. Wind + Performance

Evaluate the route against current/forecast environmental conditions and aircraft performance. This stage may modify:

- ground speed;
- heading;
- altitude;
- segment timing;
- energy consumption;
- reserve requirements.

### 7. 4D Trajectory

Convert each route into a time-dependent trajectory:

```
T = f(latitude, longitude, altitude, time)
```

The conflict engine operates on these 4D trajectories rather than on 2D route lines alone.

### 8. 4D Conflict Verify

Verify fleet-wide separation and identify:

- spatial intersections;
- temporal overlap at intersections;
- insufficient separation margins;
- convergence into the same operational volume;
- conflicts introduced by wind/performance timing changes.

A geometric crossing is not automatically an operational conflict if the required separation is maintained in time and/or altitude; the 4D verification determines the actual conflict state.

### 9. Ground Conflict Resolution

If a conflict remains and cannot be eliminated by changing the zones/routes, apply bounded planned corrections:

**Temporal correction**
- delay range: **0–5 seconds**.

**Vertical correction**
- change altitude only when permitted by mission constraints, aircraft capability, restricted-airspace limits and applicable operational rules.

The term **Ground Conflict Resolution** refers to resolution performed by the planning/ground system before execution. It does not mean an instruction to improvise an unsafe maneuver in flight.

### 10. Final Check

After every correction, rerun:

- constraints;
- route validity;
- aircraft capability;
- wind/performance;
- energy/reserve;
- 4D conflict verification.

Only a plan that passes the complete final check may proceed to the next mission/authorization stage.

## Conflict-resolution priority

1. **Spatial separation by zone partition**
2. **Route separation inside assigned zones**
3. **4D verification**
4. **Temporal correction up to 5 s**
5. **Permitted vertical correction**
6. **Re-verification**
7. **Reject/hold the plan if unresolved**

This ordering keeps conflict handling deterministic, auditable and traceable.
